The science problems we're fundamentally trying to get at: How do the starspots evolve? What is the rate of differential rotation? Are there active latitudes/bands? Can the in-transit spots be the source of the out-of-transit modulations?

The ways to get starspot properties from our data:

1. [Light curve inversion](https://github.com/rapidsnow/Eclipse-Mapping)
2. [Direct forward modeling](https://github.com/lesliehebb/STSP)
3. Fit Gaussians to the starspot "bumps", do math to find longitude (and latitude) they translate to
